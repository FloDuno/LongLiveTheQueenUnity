# LongLiveTheQueenUnity
Base to make a Long Live The Queen clone

Story made with Ink : http://www.inklestudios.com/ink/

Text scene is only here for testing. MainMenu is the real scene.

In Assets/ConfigFiles you can can change the player stats via the CharacterStats asset and the "lessons" with the ActivityWeek asset (the other ones aren't implemented yet).
In the ActivityWeek asset, the Activities Equal Stat is to make a lesson for every stat and every lesson increase chosen stat by one.

If you want to change the story, edit the Story.ink file and don't forget to export to JSON. You'll figure how to choose which day equals wich text by reading the file itself.

In the MainMenu scene, in the GameManager on the camera, the Elegance var is just for debug, don't mind it.


It's been a pain in the ass, reallyâ€¦
